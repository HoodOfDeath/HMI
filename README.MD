This project is a result of making test assignment.

Everything is needed to check it's functionality is setted up.

Every part of UI that is a subject of that assignment have been provided with testing functionality, which in turn go through every state of element.

Main parts are:

1) Speedometer, which consist of a radial indicator that is placed slightly on left from center, numerical representation of speed, and drive mode indicator.

2) Preview for media player, that can scroll left and right. Scroll behaviour can be tuned with data in editor.

3) Indicators panels on top. Indicators have 3 states: on, off and blinking.

Every element, except speedometer itself, changes it's state with period of several seconds.
